## Project Overview
The **Student Record Management System** is a Python-based desktop application developed using **Tkinter GUI**.  
The system allows users to efficiently manage student records including **Roll Number, Name, and GPA** by applying core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts.

This project is designed as an academic assignment to demonstrate practical implementation of DSA with a graphical interface.
